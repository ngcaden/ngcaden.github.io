As the Webmaster of Imperial Physics Society, I upgraded the website to a modern RESTful API system. The upgraded site consisted of a Laravel API back-end and a dynamic AngularJS front-end. I developed new features for the website as well as keeping the PhySoc website up-to-date with the latest events.  My role also entailed creating bespoke authentication solution to work with the Union's LDAP credentials system. The website plays a major role in engaging over a thousand of members within the society, as well as enabling members to be alerted and to sign up to events which has a major part in the society's success.
