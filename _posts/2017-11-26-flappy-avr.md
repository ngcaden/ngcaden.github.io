A version of the addictive Flappy Bird game were engineered using a ATmega128 microprocessor. The interfaces for the machine include a button to accept user's input, a speaker to play music and an oscilloscope to display the game and the high score. What makes this project special was that all device drivers (graphical and sound), the game physics and the game sequence were programmed in machine-level Assembly language. The project was an unique learning experience for me to engineer programmes without abstractions and understand the working of computers at electronic level.

You can watch the demo of the project on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/hxxKrKEfyKI). Additionally, the source code of the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ngcaden/FlappyAVR).
