Analysing grammar and syntax, a sentence grammar checker was created 


Prolog was used. As a logical analysis
The programme utilised Prolog, a general-purpose logic programming language 
fundamental to computational linguistics.

A Prolog program is essentially a set of premises, expressed in a logical language (this is the LOGIC). It is run by making a statement in the logical language, which the Prolog interpreter tries to prove, given the premises in the program. The strategy the interpreter uses to attempt to construct a proof is the CONTROL. Logic and control are the two fundamental concepts in logic programming. This chapter describes the logic and control of Prolog.

The programme also generated grammartically correct sentences
