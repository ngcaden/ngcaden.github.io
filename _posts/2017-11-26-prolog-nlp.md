Utilising logic-based learning, I constructed a Prolog programme to perform natural language processing. The programme was able to check whether or not an English sentence is grammatically correct, according to given rules. Grammatically correct sentences could also be generated as the output. The programming language, Prolog, is a general-purpose logic language fundamental to computational linguistics. The project trained me on concepts such as logic predicates, lexicology and grammar.
