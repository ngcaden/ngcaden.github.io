The Time Tracker App was constructed for keeping track of time spent in deep work. Daily and Weekly Views helps to compare progress daily and across the weeks. The project has taken inspiration from the organisation framework detailed in the book **Deep Work** by *Cal Newport*.

The back-end of the web application utilised Heroku Free Hosting Plan and Postgres Hobby Database.

The application demo can be accessed [here](https://personal-time-app-eu.herokuapp.com).
