The Enigma machine is a encryption machine developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Most notably, it was used by the Germam forces during the Second World War. A software version of this complex machine was implemented in C++. Components of the machine: the plugboard, the rotors and the reflector were all programmed using object-oriented method. The programme was able to obtain configurations from the users for the Enigma machine and encrypt (or decrypt) messages and output them to the command line.
