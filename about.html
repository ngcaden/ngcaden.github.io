<p>
    A passionate software engineer, pursuing impactful appications through data-driven solutions. Utilising physical analytics, focusing on leveraging machine learning tools to create tangible benefits in people's daily lives. I am inspired by how computers and data can empower research and business analytics.
</p>

<p>
    During my time as an undergraduate researcher at Imperial College, I built a hurricane risk engine for the Western Pacific region. Through aggregation of large multi-dimensional datasets, identification of novel patterns and engineering new statistical features, my work has helped to improve the previous model's accuracy by more than 30%. Today, I continue to work with the Imperial Space and Atmospheric Group to improve hurricane forecasting through image recognition on satellite imageries.

<p>
    A background in physics and engineering also positions me at the intersection between science and technology. My knowledge in computing helps me to create efficient solutions that interact with humans meaningfully. My experience ranges from administering the College Union to building web technologies.
</p>

<p>
    I am seeking to apply my skills and knowledge to improve industry applications through the incorporation of machine learning.
